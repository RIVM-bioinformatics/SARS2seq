# How to plot graphs. Different templates can override these settings, but
# the default template can use interactive plots (Javascript using HighCharts)
# or flat plots (images, using MatPlotLib). With interactive plots, the report
# can prevent automatically rendering all graphs if there are lots of samples
# to prevent the browser being locked up when the report opens.
plots_force_flat: False          # Try to use only flat image graphs
plots_force_interactive: False   # Try to use only interactive javascript graphs
plots_flat_numseries: 250        # If neither of the above, use flat if > this number of datasets
num_datasets_plot_limit: 50      # If interactive, don't plot on load if > this number of datasets
max_table_rows: 1500             # Swap tables for a beeswarm plot above this
