# tabCompleter Class taken from https://gist.github.com/iamatypeofwalrus/5637895
## this was intended for the raw_input() function of python. But that one is deprecated now
## this also seems to work for the new input() functions however so muy bueno
#! use the gnureadline module instead of readline module
##! the 'normal' readline module causes a bug with memory pointers
